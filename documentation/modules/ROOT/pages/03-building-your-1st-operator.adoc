= Building your first {operator_type} operator

[#create-operator-scaffold]
== Create the operator scaffold

Let’s create the project scafflod using `operator-sdk init`. 

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
operator-sdk init --plugins=ansible --domain=$\{ORGANIZATION}
----

You should get something like this…

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
Next: define a resource with:
$ operator-sdk create api
----

As the suggested let’s create an api.

[#create-an-api]
== Create an API

We’re not covering the basics around operators in this chapter but you can find an overview of some concopts xref:07-annexes.adoc[here].

As we explained in the xref:index.adoc#controllers[overview] `CRDs` are like classes and `CRs` like instances of those and a `Controller` tracks its state and tries to move it to the desired state expressed in `CRs`. Or if you like CRs are the fuel for Controllers, the heart of our operator.

In the case of our operator the CRD is simple, it comprises the next attributes:

* *size*: number of Memcached replicas

We have digressed a little, so, let's go back to the task we have to carry out, _creating an API_. Well, creating an API in the context of an {operator_type} operator means, generating an empty role and provide the means to trigger it everytime an `{crd_name}` `CR` is created, modified or deleted. 

Run the next command that creates an {operator_type} role related to our operator `CRD`, `{crd_name}`.

NOTE: The name of the role is auto-generated, `{crd_name_lc}` in this case.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
operator-sdk create api --group $\{APP_NAME} --version v1 --kind {crd_name} --generate-role
----

You can find the generated role, `{crd_name_lc}`, inside `./roles` additionally `watches.yaml` has been updated with the following. As you can see the contents of `watches.yaml` connects a given `GKV` (Group, Kind and Version) with a `role`.

NOTE: As the name `watches.yaml` suggests, our operator _watches_ different objects and execute roles everytime changes are detected.

.`watches.yaml` extract matching the CRD with the role you just generated
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
---
# Use the 'create api' subcommand to add watches to this file.
- version: v1
  group: minerva.atarazana
  kind: {crd_name}
  role: {crd_name_lc}
# +kubebuilder:scaffold:watch

[#setup-python-venv]
== Setup a Python virtual environment

I’m using macOS and I found that in order to meet the requirements to run my role I needed to update Python to a level macOS didn’t like… so I googled my problem and hit link:https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Python/virtualenv.html[this] gem.

So the idea is to create a virtual python environment… bear with me and run this commands inside the project folder.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
----

Now your prompt should look like `(venv)`. Please run these commands to install required modules.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
pip install ansible
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
pip install ansible ansible-runner ansible-runner-http openshift jmespath
----

NOTE: To leave the virtual env just deactivate it with `deactivate`.

[#init-repo]
== Init the git repo

Let's define first what to ignore by adding this at the end of the file `.gitignore`.

CAUTION: Run this once... or you'll get these lines added multiple times.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cat << EOF >> .gitignore
# Other
.DS_Store
downloaded/

# Virtual Python Env
venv/
EOF
----

Init the repo and add all files so far.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git init
git add .gitignore
git add *
git commit -a -m "init"
----

== Let’s add some sugar to the Makefile

Now we’re going to replace the Makefile with the next one. Open `./Makefile` and substitute the content with this.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::example$Makefile.example[]
----

Now let’s explain a little what we have changed.

.*Variables:*
____
Don’t worry if you don’t know what’s a bundle, a bundle index or a catalog we’ll cover that later. Just be conscious of the changes we have made.
____

* We have deleted the `VERSION ?= 0.0.1` and added `include settings.sh`
* Changed `BUNDLE_IMG` so that the bundle image is a full name related to the operator name and version
* Added `FROM_BUNDLE_IMG` to do the same but for the previous version, in this demo it will be 0.0.1
* Added `Bundle Index tag` section to define bundle index images similarly to the bundle images
* Updated `IMG`, again to make the operator image name dependent of the environment variables.
* Added target `undeploy` to delete all the objects created when `deploy` is run
* Added targets `bundle-push`, `bundle-validate` and `bundle-all` to push the bundle image to the registry, validate it or do all at once
* Added targets `index-build`, `index-push`, `index-export` and `index-registry-serve` to handle bundle indexes and debug if necessary
* Added targets `catalog-deploy-prev`, `install-operator`, `catalog-deploy`, `upgrade-operator`, `uninstall-operator` and `catalog-undeploy` to handle the operator catalog and as a whole to run a demonstration.

[NOTE]
========
Take into account that this guide and it's assets were created for demonstration purposes, you should take it as a source of inspiration and to help you get started not as a _one-size-fit-all-kind-of_ template.

== Building v0.0.1

Well it’s time to look into the code and make it actually do something.
As we have explained at the core of any operator lays a controller watching at Kubernetes events, in particular events related to objects of interest, for instance our CRDs and other object the operator owns (Pods, Deployments, etc.).

[#adding-actual-code]
=== Adding Actual Code

In this simple example we want to deploy a Memcached cluster and one of the attributes of the specification of the cluster
could include `number of replicas` as an attribute, right? We will call that attribute `size`.

Please open `./roles/{crd_name_lc}/tasks/main.yml` and substitute the content with this:

NOTE: We use `k8s` module to create and maintain a `Deployment` object that creates a Memcached cluster which number of replicas is `size`.

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::example${crd_name_lc}-role-main-task-v0.0.1.yaml[]
----

[#defining-crd]
=== Defining the CRD (API)

We haven't fully defined the API because we haven't updated the `CRD` nor the sample `CR`, let's do it.

Let’s update the CRD, open `./config/crd/bases/minerva.atarazana_appdefinitions.yaml` and substitute with this.
